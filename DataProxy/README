Curl commands for testing if server is running successfully on your pc can be found in "src/CurlCommands".
You can change the port and address of the server in "resources/application.conf".

For building this project, the obsolete Ktor(version 1.5.1)  plugin for in intellij has been used.
Newer version was not available to public.

Tests can be written in the "test/" directory. Please create Test classes for new components.

Databaseojects and Data classes are defined in "src/DatabaseObjects". Based on some designchoices in the client we might want to move the
data classes into some util folder that is shared between the client and the server.

Routing happens in "src/Application.kt".

The DatabaseConnector is currently using an In-Memory database. The database is cleared after shutting down the server.

Added Dependencies can be seen in the build.gradle file
